	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<h3>ITChristos</h3>

		<p>Thank you for visiting my webpage dedicated to network certification studies. Here I hope that we can build a community dedicated to helping each-other learn networking concepts, share resources,
		   build relationships, and become all-around better people. This website was created with the advancement of like-minded professionals in consideration. First, let me introduce myself:</p>
	
		<p>My name is Christos Panas and I am currently studying for my <span class="boldtext">CCNA,</span>. I live in Yelm, WA and am currently working for the United States Army. I serve as a Sniper Section 
		   Leader in a Recconaisance Squadron at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. I have been in the military for almost 10 years now, but it has come time for me to get out and rejoining the rest of the civilian world. 
		   I have a girlfriend, Lindsay, and two sons, Cooper and Nolan. Everything that I do is for them, including gaining certifications and networking. The IT sector is a lucrative and growing market that is
		   going to be expanding for a very long time. Because of that, I know that getting a job in IT will be the best move to take care of my family. However, studying and taking the many required IT certifications
		   can be a very expensive process and for the majority of people seeking to gain an entry-level position, we just don't have the capital to spend on it.</p>	
		   
		<p>I have noticed that there is a lack of community groups that are completely free. Most companies want you to spend your hard-earned
		   money to even get a foot in the door. Even then, they limit the useful resources to premier accounts, or add-ons. I would like to contribute my time and effort into making a completely free to use
		   community that is there to help people gain the certifications that will change their life, all while remaining free to use.</p>
